# 32-bit MIPS Pipelined Processor

In this project, we as a group of three implemented a MIPS ISA based pipelined processor in Verilog code using behavioral modeling style. We also incorporated a hazard detection unit for data and control hazards, and a data-forwarding unit to eliminate potential data hazards from occurrence for the instructions chosen.
